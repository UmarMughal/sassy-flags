## Sassy Flags

#### Introduction
Sassy Flags is a lightweight Sass libary you can use to display flags on your site. It's super simple but let me go over how to use it below.

#### How to use
To use Sassy Flags just add an element to your exsiting code, then give it the class of `'flag'`. Now you can look in the `sassy-flags.scss` document and find the country code of the flag you want, heres an example for the UK flag:
```
<span class="flag gb"></span>
```

#### Support
I will be adding more flags over time, currently I have made flags for:

  * AE (United Arab Emirates)
  * BR (Brazil)
  * CH (Switzerland)
  * DE (Germany)
  * ES (Spain)
  * GB (United Kingdom)
  * JP (Japan)
  * RU (Russia)
  * SE (Sweden)
  * SO (Somalia)
  * UA (Ukraine)
  * US (United States of America)
  * VN (Veitnam)

#### Thanks
